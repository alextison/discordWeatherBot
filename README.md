**Weather bot** - A discord.js bot with features related to weather written with TypeScript.

## Introduction

This template was created to give developers a starting point for new Discord bots, so that much of the initial setup can be avoided and developers can instead focus on meaningful bot features. Developers can simply copy this repo, follow the [setup instructions](#setup) below, and have a working bot with many [boilerplate features](#features) already included!

### Info Command

A `/info` command to get information about the bot, links to different resources, or developer information.

## Setup

1. Copy example config files.
    - Navigate to the `config` folder of this project.
    - Copy all files ending in `.example.json` and remove the `.example` from the copied file names.
        - Ex: `config.example.json` should be copied and renamed as `config.json`.
2. Obtain a bot token.
    - You'll need to create a new bot in your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
        - See [here](https://www.writebots.com/discord-bot-token/) for detailed instructions.
        - At the end you should have a **bot token**.
3. Modify the config file.
    - Open the `config/config.json` file.
    - You'll need to edit the following values:
        - `client.id` - Your discord bot's [user ID](https://techswift.org/2020/04/22/how-to-find-your-user-id-on-discord/).
        - `client.token` - Your discord bot's token.
4. Install packages.
    - Navigate into the downloaded source files and type `npm install`.
5. Register commands.
    - In order to use slash commands, they first [have to be registered](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/command-deployment.html).
    - Type `npm run commands:register` to register the bot's commands.
        - Run this script any time you change a command name, structure, or add/remove commands.
        - This is so Discord knows what your commands look like.
        - It may take up to an hour for command changes to appear.

## Start Scripts

You can run the bot in multiple modes:

1. Normal Mode
    - Type `npm start`.
    - Starts a single instance of the bot.
2. Manager Mode
    - Type `npm run start:manager`.
    - Starts a shard manager which will spawn multiple bot shards.
3. PM2 Mode
    - Type `npm run start:pm2`.
    - Similar to Manager Mode but uses [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) to manage processes.
